## Tomorrow's Priority Tasks

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Fetch Nedeljkovic 2024 study full text**
   - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-023-10278-z
   - This may contain the prevalence estimates we need
   - Extract: prevalence rates, methodology details

2. **Fetch ESPAD 2019 Serbia data**
   - https://www.euda.europa.eu/publications/espad-report/2019_en
   - Extract gambling statistics for Serbian youth
   - Compare with other countries

3. **Check ESPAD 2024 for Serbia**
   - Released October 21, 2025
   - Check if Serbia participated
   - If yes, extract new youth gambling data

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

4. **Search for clinical data**
   - Belgrade psychiatric clinic patient numbers
   - Helpline call statistics if available

5. **Complete international comparison**
   - UK problem gambling rate (0.5%?)
   - Australian rate
   - Croatian and Slovenian rates if available

6. **Check for any NGO reports**
   - Organizations working with gambling addicts
   - Qualitative data on harm

## Preliminary Conclusion

**Based on research so far:**

The answer to "Are there new prevalence data after 2018?" appears to be **PARTIAL YES**:

- The 2024 Nedeljkovic study (7,385 adults) may contain updated prevalence estimates
- However, this appears to be analysis of existing data, not a new comprehensive national survey
- No evidence of a new standalone national prevalence study commissioned
- ESPAD 2019 has youth data but is now 6 years old
- ESPAD 2024 may have newer youth data

**Likely final conclusion:**
"The 2018 estimate of 51,000-93,000 problem gamblers remains the most recent national prevalence figure. However, a 2024 study by Nedeljkovic et al. provides updated risk factor analysis on a sample of 7,385 adults. A new comprehensive national prevalence study is urgently needed to assess:
1. Impact of increased online gambling access
2. Effects of 2024 law reforms
3. Post-COVID gambling trends"
