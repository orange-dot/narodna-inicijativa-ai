**There is increasing public health concern about harmful gambling, but no consensus on effective policies and  interventions to reduce risk and prevent harm has been reached. Focusing on policies and interventions (ie,  measures), the aim of this study was to determine if expert consensus could be reached on measures perceived to be  effective that could be implemented successfully. Our work involved a pre-registered, three-round, independent  Delphi panel consensus study and an implementation rating exercise. A starting set of 103 universal and targeted  measures, which were sourced from several key resources and inputs from public health stakeholders, were grouped  into seven domains: price and taxation; availability; accessibility; marketing, advertising, promotion, and sponsorship;  environment and technology; information and education; and treatment and support. Across three rounds, an  independent panel of 35 experts individually completed online questionnaires to rank each measure for known or  potential effectiveness. A consensus was reached if at least 70% of the panel judged a measure to be either not  effective, moderately effective, or highly effective. Then, each measure that reached a consensus for effectiveness was  evaluated on four implementation dimensions: practicability, affordability, side-effects, and equity. A summative  threshold criterion was used to select a final optimal set of measures for England. The panel reached consensus on  83 (81%) of 103 measures. Two measures were judged as ineffective by the panel. The remaining 81 effective measures  were drawn from all domains (14 of 15 measures in the the marketing, advertising, promotion, and sponsorship  domain were judged as effective, whereas five of ten measures in the information and education domain were judged  as effective). During the evaluation exercise, the 81 measures were assessed for likelihood of implementation success.  This assessment considered the practicality, affordability, ability to generate unanticipated side-effects, and ability to  decrease differences between advantaged and disadvantaged groups in society of each measure. We identified  40 universal and targeted measures to tackle harmful gambling (three measures from the price and taxation domain;  ten from the availability domain; five from the accessibility domain; six from the marketing, advertising, promotion,  and sponsorship domain; eight from the environment and technology domain; three from the information and  education domain; and five from the treatment and support domain). Implementation of these measures in England  could substantially strengthen regulatory controls while providing new resources. The findings of our work offer a  blueprint for a public health approach to preventing harms related to gambling.**

Gambling products are developed, marketed, and  operated by a highly differentiated and profitable global  industry.1 Until relatively recently, successive govern ments and industry stakeholders have portrayed  gambling as an infrequent and inconsequential leisure  activity, while acknowledging that a small population of  so-called compulsive gamblers experience severe  negative effects as a result of their gambling.2 In the last  5 years, it has been widely recognised that health, social,  and economic harms are experienced by a relatively large  population of gamblers, their families, those in their  social network, and those in their community.3 

Calls for a public health approach to tackle harmful  gambling were first made in the late 1990s,4 and are now  increasing.5,6 A whole-population, continuum-of-harm  perspective, which involves universal and targeted  prevention and treatment initiatives and the modification  of the social, commercial, and environmental deter 

minants of health inequalities, is currently being called  for. To date, there has been limited research and policy  evaluation on gambling to inform this approach.  Gambling industry stakeholders have used their power    
on the rationale and effectiveness of a public health  approach.7 These stakeholders have deployed the same  arguments that have been used by other unhealthy  commodity actors by contending that: the gambling  industry is a responsible entity; gambling harm arises  through individual choice; personal responsibility is key;  and voluntary or self-regulatory policy is the most  appropriate means of protecting the population.8 

For other public health concerns (including alcohol  use; tobacco use; and the consumption of food and  drinks that are high in fat, salt, or sugar) there is well  developed evidence on policies and interventions  (referred to as measures). Various measures including  price and taxation regulations, restrictions on marketing,  and provision of treatment have been associated with  reduced demand and improved health in the context of  these public health concerns.9–11 Although there are  differences between gambling and these other public  health issues—both in terms of the specificity of  gambling harms and the characteristics of gambling  products that are harmful—there are also important  similarities between them, including social acceptability,

the presence of a powerful industry, and the role of socio environmental effects on behaviour.12,13 It is reasonable to  assume that some of the measures used for other public  health concerns could be adapted alongside gambling specific measures. For example, this approach has been  used in the UK to reduce the negative effects of a type of  electronic gaming machine (EGM) known as fixed odds  betting terminals, by introducing price restrictions.14 

Policy in England to address harmful gambling has been  

characterised by an approach that is focused on individual level and personal responsibility.15 However, in the past  5 years, several reviews have galvanised a public health  agenda. In 2016, the Department of Digital, Culture, Media  

**Methods** 

We conducted a pre-registered, two-phase online Delphi  consensus and implementation rating study. In the  first phase, a panel of experts independent from  PHE anonymously completed a questionnaire over  three rounds to rank measures for their effectiveness.  Between each round, there was an interval of 8–12 days.  In the second phase, MS, ZC, CH, and JM rated each  effective measure on a set of dimensions to evaluate  likelihood of successful implementation in England. The  panel survey and implementation evaluation phases of  the study were done between March 11 and July 13, 2021\. 

The protocol was approved by PHE’s Research Ethics  

For the **protocol published on  the Open Science Framework**  see https://osf.io/3m7ar/  
and Sport reviewed EGMs and social responsibility  measures.16 The Gambling Related Harm All Party  Parliamentary Group was also established in 2016\. In 2020,  a House of Lords Select Committee published a  comprehensive review17 and the Gambling Commission  published a 3-year strategy.18 The UK Parliament Gambling  Act 2005 is now under review with an objective to find  ways of better protecting vulnerable people. 

The Department for Health and Social Care asked  Public Health England (PHE) to review the evidence on  gambling-related harms to inform prevention and  treatment, which was published in 2021\.19 Concurrently,  the National Institute for Health and Care Research  commissioned a mapping review of measures to reduce  the public health burden of gambling-related harms, but  this study identified little evidence.20 

There is a scarcity of literature on a whole-population,  public health approach to tackle harmful gambling. An  umbrella review by McMahon and colleagues21 on  prevention and education interventions identified  low-quality evidence from individual-level interventions  targeting gamblers with severe problems. Little is known  about measures that have long-term effectiveness or  measures that are likely to be successfully implemented.  Reflecting on evidence from other areas of public health,  Livingstone and colleagues22 suggested policies and  interventions that might be effective to prevent gambling related harm. 

Given this dearth of evidence, we conceived an online  Delphi study to determine consensus on measures to  prevent and reduce harmful gambling. This method is  widely used in the health sciences and is regarded as the  most rigorous method for determining group  consensus.23–25 

In the gambling field, Delphi studies have been  reported on: screening tests;26 counsellor competencies;27 and how friends, family, or members of the public can  recognise and support someone with gambling  problems,28 but there has been no consensus study on  effective measures for a public health approach.  Accordingly, we aimed to determine evidence for  consensus among an independent group of experts on  effective measures that have potential for successful  implementation in England.

**Panel recruitment** 

There is no consensus on the number of experts for an  online Delphi panel, but it has been recommended that  having around 30 members works well.30 We sought a  panel with a mix of personal and professional expertise.  We included people with lived experience of harmful  gambling and people involved in: academic research;  service delivery and commissioning; national and local  regulations; and public health policy. Panel members  were recruited from countries in the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 

We identified potential panel members by accessing  our professional networks and by contacting orga nisations supporting people harmed by gambling (eg, the  Lived Experience Forum on Gambling Harms, which  was established by the Health and Social Care Alliance  Scotland31). All members of the panel were provided with  a participant information sheet which included specific  contact details for people within the team who could help  with practical questions. 

Not being directly affiliated with the gambling industry  was a prerequisite for panel membership. Employees of  the industry and its affiliated organisations, and those  with other direct financial connections, were ineligible.  We anticipated that some experts might have indirect or  historical financial relationships with the industry due to  the mechanism by which the majority of research,  education, and treatment has been funded in the UK.15 To  secure a panel with a mix of expertise, we allowed  participation from experts with current indirect funding  from the Gambling Commission, GambleAware, an  industry-related levy, or international equivalent, and  those who had received direct funding from the industry  over 10 years ago, when it was not feasible to secure  participation with more stringent criteria. Eligible experts  were required to complete a declaration of interest  statement. 

**Domains and measures** 

Between November, 2020 and February, 2021, we  compiled an initial set of measures through a review of  

**e706** www.thelancet.com/public-health **Vol 7 August 2022**   
**Health Policy** 

the following material: official guidance and consultation    
round one. Two additional measures were added in  

documents on gambling excise duty;32 gambling price  elasticities;33 licensing and regulation;34,35 broadcast and  other advertising codes;36–38 marketing and advertising  law;39 general health promotion;40 and two influential  reports (the review of measures for the Victorian  Responsible Gambling Foundation39 and the House of  Lords’ review17). 

We asked 77 experts from our professional networks to  recommend measures from their public health fields  that might be applied to gambling. Ten experts replied,  with expertise in alcohol; tobacco; drugs; diet and obesity;  and communicable and non-communicable diseases. We  also asked the online Delphi panel to review a draft set of  measures and recommend measures that they believed  we had overlooked. The panel was also able to make  suggestions for additional measures in round one. We  adjusted the written description of measures for clarity  and readability. 

A total of 103 universal and targeted measures were  identified. Rather than displaying the measures  randomly, we judged that a pragmatic grouping of  measures into seven domains would assist the flow of  the questionnaire. The measures were grouped by  general outcome, but not necessarily by mechanism of  action. The seven domains we grouped the measures  into were: price and taxation; availability; accessibility;  marketing, advertising, promotion, and sponsorship;  environment and technology; information and education;  and treatment and support. The wording used to describe  each measure is in the appendix (pp 2–5). 

*Price and taxation* 

We grouped 11 measures into the price and taxation  domain. These measures (including increasing operators’  duties; taxing wagers; and banning use of credit for  gambling) seek to make gambling products less affordable  and profitable for gambling operators. Nine measures  were included in this domain in round one. Two additional  measures were added in round two. 

*Availability* 

We grouped 19 measures into the availability domain.  These measures (including capping customer deposits;  spending restrictions in gambling premises and on  gambling products; and tackling unregulated operators)  seek to reduce exposure to products and related services.  17 measures were included in round one. Two additional  measures were added in round two. 

*Accessibility* 

We grouped 14 measures into the accessibility domain.  These measures (including restricting access to  gambling products; instituting a minimum and verified  legal age for gambling; and affordability checks) seek to  reduce exposure among vulnerable people and those  experiencing harm. 12 measures were included in    
round two. 

*Marketing, advertising, promotion, and sponsorship* We grouped 15 measures into the marketing, advertising,  promotion, and sponsorship domain. These measures  (including prohibiting or restricting advertising and  marketing on television, radio, social media, and  streaming and banning sports sponsorships) seek to  reduce general exposure to gambling products and  related services. 14 measures were included in round one.  One additional measure was added in round two. 

*Environment and technology* 

We grouped 21 measures into the environment and  technology domain. These measures (including banning  automated teller machines in gambling premises;  banning bonus play features on EGMs and online games;  assessing new gambling products for risk of harm; and  mandating that EGMs display cash rather than credit  amounts) seek to reduce exposure to product technologies  that are designed to manipulate gambling behaviour.  19 measures were included in round one. Two measures  were added in round two. 

*Information and education* 

We grouped ten measures into the information and  education domain. These measures (including displaying  health messaging on gambling products and websites and  public health information campaigns) seek to increase  knowledge and understanding of the risks and harmful  effects of gambling. Nine measures were included in  round one. One measure was added in round two. 

*Treatment and support* 

We grouped 13 measures into the treatment and  support domain. These measures (including structured  psychosocial and pharmacological interventions; iden tification and brief advice interventions; and facilitation  of mutual aid for recovery) seek to help individuals at  risk of or experiencing harmful effects associated with  gambling. 12 measures were included in round one.  One measure was added in round two. 

**Analysis**   
*Questionnaire* 

An online software (DelphiManager version 5; COMET  Initiative; Liverpool) was used to build a secure, web accessed, questionnaire.41 Piloting indicated that this  could be completed in 30 min. We instructed the panel  to reflect on their knowledge of gambling and rank  each measure for effectiveness in reducing gambling related harms by selecting one number on the following  nine-point scale: 1–3 being not effective or has no  potential to be effective (ie, not recommended);  4–6 being moderately effective or has potential to be  moderately effective (ie, recommended); and 7–9 being  

See **Online** for appendix

www.thelancet.com/public-health **Vol 7 August 2022 e707**   
**Health Policy** 

highly effective or has potential to be highly effective  (ie, highly recommended). 

For each measure, an unable to rate response was  

available if the member considered that they did not have  sufficient knowledge to answer. We asked the panel to  not consider feasibility and cost issues, because these  issues would be evaluated in the second phase of the  study. 

Using the online software’s default settings, the  

seven domains were randomly presented in each round.  The questionnaire could be completed over several  sessions, and there was an option to amend ratings  before uploading it. The software automatically  constructed each questionnaire to display the panel’s  aggregated ranking for each measure alongside each  member’s response. 

Following research guidelines,23 we set the criterion for  

consensus at 70% (ie, at least 70% of the panel needed to  judge a measure as not effective \[rank 1–3\], moderately  effective \[rank 4–6\], or highly effective \[rank 7–9\] for  consensus to be achieved). If more than 50% of the panel  were unable to rate, the measure was removed. All  measures were included in at least two of the  three rounds.  

At completion of the online Delphi process, each  

measure that reached consensus for moderate or high  effectiveness was taken forward into the second phase. 

*Rating of implementation success* 

We adapted the acceptability, practicability, effectiveness,  affordability, side-effects, and equity (APEASE) framework42  for our evaluation of implementation success. We removed  the acceptability and effectiveness criteria from our  analysis. The public and political acceptability dimension  fell outside the scope of this study because these are major  and dynamic issues that require a separate investigation.  The effectiveness dimension was not included because  this had been addressed by the Delphi panel. The adapted  framework (ie, the PASE framework) that we used asked  questions about practicability (ie, to what extent would the  measure be hard or easy to implement?); affordability  (ie, to what extent would the measure be unaffordable or  affordable when delivered as intended?); side-effects (ie, to  what extent would the measure lead to unintended adverse  or beneficial health outcomes?); and equity (ie, to what  extent would the measure increase or decrease differences  between advantaged and disadvantaged groups in society?). Individually, four members of the research team (ZC,  

CH, JM, and MS) rated each measure produced from  phase one on an 11-point scale (–5 to 5\) for each of the  four PASE dimensions. Higher scores in the positive  direction of the scale indicated greater implementation  success. For each measure, a total score was computed as  the sum of the ratings across raters (expressed as the  percentage of the total maximum score). 

The original APEASE framework does not include a  

mandated scoring system, so we used a simple total  

score cut-off of more than 50% to determine that the  measure would have implementation success (ie, it  would be relatively easy to implement; it would be  relatively affordable; it would be capable of generating  unintended beneficial outcomes; and it would decrease  social disparities). 

Rankings from the online Delphi process were  tabulated by measure and domain. The McNemar  statistic (p=0∙05) was computed to evaluate evidence for  the convergence between round one and round two and  between round two and round three, for each pair of  ratings. Ratings of implementation success were  tabulated. 

**Results** 

A total of 86 experts were identified. After screening,  62 experts were invited to be panel members. 12 experts  did not reply, eight declined, two did not declare their  interests and were excluded, and two withdrew before  the first round due to competing commitments.  38 experts were recruited to the panel and were sent the  first round of the questionnaire. Among these 38 experts,  two did not respond to repeated requests to complete the  questionnaire and one stated their wish to contribute but  did not respond to the questionnaire. The flowchart of  panel members is shown in the appendix (p 14). 

The characteristics (ie, gender, country, expertise, and  declaration of interests) of the 35 members included on  the online Delphi panel that completed one or more  rounds of the questionnaire are shown in the  appendix (p 2). All completed round one, with  one member then withdrawing. Out of the 34 members  involved in rounds two and three, 32 (94%) completed  the questionnaire in round 2 and 31 (91%) completed the  questionnaire in round three. 

Table 1 shows the panel’s aggregate ranks for each  measure by round. The unable to rate option was used  on at least one measure in round one by 21 (60%) of  35 panel members, in round two by 13 (38%) of 34 panel  members, and in round three by 7 (21%) of 34 panel  members. Given the criterion set, no measure was  removed due to the unable to rate response. 

The panel did not reach consensus on 20 measures.  The absence of consensus was most apparent in the  information and education domain (consensus was not  reached for five of ten measures in this domain).  Two measures (both in the availability domain) were  judged to be ineffective: maximum limit on customers  gambling on an operator’s website at once (consensus  score 77%) and create a state-owned gambling monopoly  (consensus score 72%). 

All McNemar test statistics (p=0·05) suggested that  there was no convergence from ineffectiveness  (rank 1–3) to effectiveness (rank 4–9) and vice versa.  However, there was evidence of a general tendency for  an increase in the proportion of members ranking  measures within the moderately effective and highly

Data are the number of panel members that completed each round of the questionnaire (n) and the percentage of votes that each measure received, by ranking. Ranking of measures followed a nine-point scale:  1–3 being not effective or has no potential to be effective; 4–6 being moderately effective or has potential to be moderately effective; and 7–9 being highly effective or has potential to be highly effective. Empty  cells indicate that the policy or intervention was not included in round one or was removed in round three after consensus was attained.

consensus was reached on five (50%) of ten measures. In    
gambling. These estimates indicate that, for some modes  

the treatment and support domain, consensus was  reached on 10 (77%) of 13 measures.  

**Implementation success** 

The literature search to inform the implementation  success evaluation identified evidence relating to PASE  dimensions for just 11 of the 81 measures that were  judged to be effective by the panel of experts. Most of the  evidence addressed implementation practicality issues  (nine measures), and some of the evidence addressed  equity (two measures). The raters met twice over 6 h to  review search results, review feedback from two panel  members, and discuss each measure. The PASE scores  are shown in the appendix (pp 18–21). 

A total of 40 of the 81 measures received a PASE score  above the 50% criterion. In the price and taxation  domain, three (27%) of 11 measures received a score  above 50% (all of which were judged as highly effective).  In the availability domain, ten (53%) of 19 measures  received a score above 50% (six of which were judged as  highly effective). In the accessibility domain, 5 (36%) of  14 measures received a score above 50% (all of which  were judged as highly effective). In the marketing,  advertising, promotion, and sponsorship domain,  6 (40%) of 15 measures received a score above 50% (all of  which were judged as highly effective). In the  environment and technology domain, 8 (38%) of  21 measures received a score above 50% (six of which  were judged as highly effective). In the information and  education domain, three (30%) of ten measures received  a score above 50% (one of which was judged as highly  effective). In the treatment and support domain, 5 (38%)  of 13 measures received a score above 50% (four of which  were judged as highly effective). These 40 measures  constitute the final product from the study and are shown  in table 2\. 

**Discussion** 

We found that there was consensus among an  independent panel of 35 experts that 81 (79%) of  103 universal and targeted measures would be effective  elements of a comprehensive public health approach.  Among these, 40 (49%) measures (eg, changes to  taxation; bans and restrictions on the availability and  accessibility of gambling products and their marketing;  changes to the operation of specific products; and new  information and resources for public health) were rated  by members of the research team as likely to be  successfully implemented in England. 

The three measures in the price and taxation domain  (ie, increasing annual operator duties annually above  inflation; banning tax deductions on advertising,  marketing, and sponsorship costs; and funding research,  education, and treatment from general tax revenue) are  entirely new to England. In the UK, Her Majesty’s Treasury  has published estimates on the price elasticity of    
of gambling, demand reduces in response to an increase  in price, while simultaneously generating revenue for  the exchequer. This observation is relevant to the  measures presented in our study, given that increases in  costs to the industry would probably be passed onto the  player. Funding research, education, and treatment from  general tax revenue would align gambling with other  public health issues and remove the conflict of interest  presented by the current reliance on voluntary donations. 

All ten measures in the availability domain would also  be new for England, with the exception that one measure  (ie, maximum limit on the number of all categories of  EGMs in land-based venues) is partially implemented  with restrictions on some categories in different  settings.43 Our recommendation would streamline this  restriction with a simple blanket maximum. 

The measure to amend the aim of the Gambling Act to  include an explicit focus on preventing and reducing  harms is especially timely. This measure aligns with calls  for a move towards a harm reduction approach to  gambling and away from the industry-coined responsible  gambling concept.44 Whereas all of the measures in the  accessibility domain, those in the availability domain,  and those in the marketing, advertising, promotion, and  sponsorship domain would be new for England, there is  experience from OECD countries to support policy  development. Changes to advertising and marketing  restrictions are currently in scope as part of the review of  the Gambling Act. Although not currently implemented,  the Gambling Commission has shown interest in  developing a so-called single customer view for gambling  products (ie, where customers can see all their accounts  and activities in one place) for harm reduction. 

Five of the seven measures in the environment and  technology domain have not been used before in  England. The requirement for gambling operators and  banks to provide anonymous data on customer  participation and spending on gambling products to an  independent data repository would enable higher-quality,  unbiased data-linkage research. This type of research is  of particular importance because there is very sparse  accurate evidence on how much time people spend  gambling and on their losses. Two studies that used  banking data showed the value of access to financial  data,45,46 highlighting the financial burden of harmful  gambling and advancing the field with better outcome  measures to estimate intervention effects. 

Rather than displaying only credits, the display of  remaining cash on EGMs is available as an option for  English customers. However, we recommend that cash  amount is always displayed; such approach has been  introduced by the responsible gambling programme in  NS, Canada.47 The measure to require all gambling  operators to make customers winnings’ available to them  immediately and prohibit the cancellation of a withdrawal  request was implemented in the UK on Oct 31, 2021, by

Care Excellence; and local authorities would need to be  

only applies to online gambling. 

For the three measures in the information and  education domain (ie, display of harm reduction  messaging on EGMs and online gambling sessions;  require gambling operators to disseminate official  health-related information; and feedback of accurate real 

time information to gamblers on time spent gambling  and money lost) the panel judged that feedback to  gamblers could act as a highly effective brake during a  gambling session and that this measure should be put to  the test. Health-education campaigns often do not lead to  changes in behaviour. Furthermore, industry-led cam 

paigns (eg, the When The Fun Stops, Stop” responsible  gambling campaign in the UK) are found to be  ineffective,49 so the delivery and evaluation of risk and  harm reduction messaging will require a robust and  creative approach by public health researchers. 

Three of the five measures in the treatment and  support domain are partially implemented in England,  but there is a pressing need to increase capacity and  strengthen the evidence base for effective treatment  interventions. Two measures were related to self 

exclusion (ie, gambling account suspension and use of  product blocking software for those wanting to abstain).  Currently, all gambling providers are required to offer a  self-exclusion scheme, but provision is disjointed and  there is no single multi-operator scheme available to  those who want to abstain from all forms of gambling. 

Some gambling stakeholders might dispute the need  for, and effectiveness of, the various measures identified  in this consensus study. Very few public health  interventions are amendable to randomised controlled  trials, and we defer to the best available natural  experiments and other designs. Therefore, the standard  for implementation should be set according to the best  available evidence, coupled with the precautionary  principle, rather than some impossible-to-attain  standard, especially when there are strong reasons to act  on a harm that is occurring and could be prevented. 

Although individual measures can be effective, they are  more likely to be effective as part of a coordinated  overarching national prevention strategy. A whole-system  approach gives importance to both prevention policies  and treatment interventions. As has been seen for alcohol  and tobacco, a cross-government and inter-agency  approach is required at the national and regional scale to  facilitate the implementation of the suite of measures we  propose. Currently, in the UK, the Department of Digital,  Culture, Media & Sport holds decision-making power for  gambling policy and the Department of Health and  Social Care leads on treatment policy. Going forwards,  the Treasury would need to authorise changes to price  and taxation; the Department of Health and Social Care  and National Health Service England would need to  establish treatment care pathways, informed by clinical  guidelines set by the National Institute for Health and    
involved in many measures relating to the regulation of  gambling operators. External stakeholders, including  banks, internet providers, and the gambling industry,  would need to implement changes to their products and  services. Consideration will need to be given to how  polices can be introduced so that industry is unable to  circumvent their operation and outcomes. 

A few limitations are worth discussing. First, the  70% criterion for panel consensus was arbitrary, although  we followed best-practice guidelines. Our greater than  50% criterion for evaluating the likelihood of  implementation success was arbitrary. However, in the  event, we judge that this criterion had face validity. The  83 effective measures were cut back to 40 (a reduction  of 52%), with 21 (53%) measures achieving over 80%  consensus ratings for effectiveness.  

Second, although we considered affordability when  evaluating for implementation, we did not assess cost effectiveness or return on investment. It is possible that  some measures might be effective but turn out to be  expensive and yield lower return than cheaper and less  effective measures. 

Third, some of the measures could have been organised  and implemented in various ways, which could result in  different effects in practice. For example, it could be  argued that the measure to ban the use of credit as a  means of gambling fits equally logically in the  accessibility domain, but we felt that the resulting effects  of using credit and not being able to pay it off in full each  month does increase the cost of gambling. We are  confident that our descriptions were subject to necessary  refinement and were fit for purpose. 

**Implications for policy and research** 

We were not able to gather reasons for why consensus  was not reached for some interventions. However, our  findings do suggest that some principles are not readily  translated from other public health fields. For example,  pricing and taxation measures did not attain the highest  level of consensus. 

Although we made the decision not to consider public  and political acceptability in this study, it is undoubtedly  an important element of implementation. These matters  should be considered in any plans to take forward the  recommendations of this study, when consideration of  acceptability can be done in real time, drawing on the  expertise of the relevant decision makers and members  of the public. 

A far-reaching, well resourced, and coordinated  public health approach is needed to protect vulnerable  people, reduce exposure to gambling products, and  provide help to those who experience harms associated  with gambling. All future research and policy making  processes should strive to effectively involve experts on  the basis of their knowledge and experience of  gambling, and the public more generally, to find

**Search strategy and selection criteria** 

To inform our evaluation task, we searched the PsycINFO and  

Business Source Complete databases for systematic reviews  

published in English from OECD countries between  

Jan 1, 2014, and June 17, 2021, for evidence on PASE  

dimensions for each measure. The complete search criteria  

are in the appendix (pp 6–11). Comments received from  

online Delphi panel members were also consulted. We did not  

include studies published in languages other than English.

appropriate solutions for the issues associated with  gambling. The implementation of this set of  40 universal and targeted measures could achieve a  powerful effect, but we acknowledge that there needs to  be careful design, piloting, implementation, adjust 

ment, and evaluation to achieve the expected results.  

Our study offers a roadmap for decision makers and  

could be of practical value to the public health community  in other high-income countries with well developed  gambling industries and similar contexts.
