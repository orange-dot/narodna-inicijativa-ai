# New Zealand Gambling License Auction - Monitoring Plan & Implementation Framework

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 18 November 2025
**Status:** Active Monitoring Program
**Duration:** Q1 2025 - Q4 2026 (24 months)
**Review Cycle:** Quarterly Updates

---

## Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Establish comprehensive monitoring framework za prvu potencijalno aukcijski-baziranu implementaciju gambling licence u Novom Zelandu kao test case za Srbiju.

**Key Finding (November 2025):**
- NZ Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) razvija zakonodavstvo za regulaciju online kazina
- Očekivano usvajanje: **početak 2026. godine**
- KRITIČNA NAPOMENA: **Aukcijski sistem nije potvrđen u javno dostupnim dokumentima**
- Program nazvan: "Online Gambling Implementation Programme"
- Trenutno: Consultation faza

**Strategic Importance for Serbia:**
NZ reforma predstavlja potencijalni globalni precedent za:
- Tranziciju od offshore ka regulisanom online gambling tržištu
- Balance između fiskalne efikasnosti i harm minimization
- Licensing model u maloj/srednjoj ekonomiji (populacija 5M - uporedivo sa Srbijom)

**Critical Gap Identified:**
Inicijalna desk research ne potvrđuje aukcijski model. Monitoring će fokusirati na:
1. Identifikaciju licensing allocation mehanizma (auction vs. merit-based vs. hybrid)
2. Tracking legislative development kroz parlament
3. Consultation process i stakeholder feedback
4. Implementation timeline i milestones

## Part 1: Background - New Zealand Gambling Reform Context

### 1.1 Current Regulatory Landscape (2025)

**Existing Framework:**
- Gambling Act 2003 - glavni zakon
- Online gambling trenutno nije domaće regulisan
- Novozelandjani mogu legalno koristiti offshore casino websites
- Nema zaštite potrošača za online gambling
- Nema fiskalnog prihoda od online gambling aktivnosti

**Problem Statement (NZ Government Perspective):**
- Unregulated offshore market = no consumer protection
- Growing online gambling prevalence bez oversight
- Lost tax revenue (novac ide offshore)
- Harm minimization challenges

### 1.2 Reform Drivers

**Political Context:**
- Multi-year policy development od DIA

**International Precedents NZ Studying:**
- UK Gambling Commission model
- Australian state-based systems
- Nordic licensing frameworks (Sweden, Denmark)
- **Potencijalno:** Auction models (ako se primenjuje)

### 1.3 Očekivani Model Karakteristike

**Based on DIA Statements:**
- "Safe, fair and well-controlled online gambling environment"
- Licenced domestic operators
- Consumer protection standards
- Harm minimization requirements
- AML/CFT compliance
- Technical standards za platforms

**Unknowns (Critical for Serbia):**
- Number of licenses (unlimited, capped, or auction-limited?)

## Part 6: Risk & Contingency Planning

### 6.1 Research Risks

**Risk 1: Auction Model Not Used**
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM-HIGH (no confirmation yet)
**Impact:** HIGH (changes entire monitoring focus)
**Mitigation:**
- Broaden focus to licensing allocation mechanism generally
- Document merit-based system if used
- Extract relevant lessons (transparency, criteria, process)
- Compare auction vs. merit models for Serbia

**Risk 2: Timeline Delays**
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (legislative delays common)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (extends monitoring period)
**Mitigation:**
- Flexible quarterly reporting (adjust if delays)
- Maintain monitoring infrastructure
- Use delays to deepen research in other areas
- Budget for 2027-2028 extension if needed

**Risk 3: Limited Information Disclosure**
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM-HIGH (cabinet confidentiality)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (gaps in analysis)
**Mitigation:**
- Use OIA (Official Information Act) requests aggressively
- Cultivate journalist sources
- Monitor industry leaks
- Compare to offshore operator investor reports
- Request Parliamentary Library briefings

**Risk 4: Auction Details Confidential**
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (commercial sensitivity)
**Impact:** HIGH (can't assess auction performance)
**Mitigation:**

## Part 10: Quality Assurance & Methodology Notes

### 10.1 Research Standards

**Source Verification:**
- Primary sources preferred (government docs, legislation)
- Secondary sources (media) cross-checked with 2+ outlets
- Industry sources noted as perspective (not neutral)
- Clearly label: Confirmed facts vs. Speculation vs. Informed assumptions

**Bias Awareness:**
- Industry sources = pro-regulation, revenue-focused
- Advocacy groups = harm-focused, may oppose liberalization
- Government = balance fiscal + public health
- Our analysis = pro-reform but evidence-based

**Documentation:**
- All sources cited with URL + access date
- Documents archived (PDFs) in case of link rot
- Conflicting information flagged and investigated
- Uncertainty explicitly stated (not hidden)

### 10.2 Analytical Rigor

**Comparative Method:**
- Not just descriptive (what NZ does)
- But analytical (why, how, with what effects)
- Contextual (NZ specific factors)
- Transferable insights (what applies to Serbia)

**Counterfactual Thinking:**
- If NZ chose differently, what would happen?
- If Serbia copied exactly, what would differ?
- What are necessary vs. sufficient conditions?

**Stakeholder Balance:**
- Consider all perspectives (govt, industry, public health, consumers)
- No single stakeholder view privileged
- Serbia policymakers need full picture

### 10.3 Update & Revision Protocol

**Living Document Approach:**
- This monitoring plan is v1.0
- Will be revised as NZ situation clarifies
- Major revisions logged with version numbers
- Quarterly reports may refine methodology

**Adaptation Triggers:**
- If auction model NOT used → refocus on merit system
- If timeline delays → extend monitoring period
- If information restricted → intensify alternative sources
- If Serbia policy changes → adjust relevance framing

- [ ] License duration
- [ ] Renewal process

**Financial Model:**

**Verification:** Implementation timeline in regulations
**Impact if wrong:** Adjust monitoring schedule

**Assumption 4:** High harm minimization requirements
**Rationale:** NZ political culture, public health advocacy strength
**Verification:** Regulatory standards when published
**Impact if wrong:** Serbia may face different cost-benefit

**Assumption 5:** International operators will dominate
**Rationale:** No strong domestic online gambling industry
**Verification:** License application data
**Impact if wrong:** Local industry development model relevant

## Conclusion & Strategic Value

### Why This Matters for Serbia

**Global First-Mover (Potentially):**
If NZ uses auction model, this would be unprecedented globally for online casino licensing at national level. Most jurisdictions use:
- UK: Unlimited licensing (meet standards, pay fee)
- Malta: Semi-open (requirements-based)
- Sweden: Limited licenses but merit-based
- Netherlands: Hybrid (fit & proper + fee)

**Auction model = rare.** If NZ pioneers, Serbia can learn from:
1. Design choices (auction format)
2. Implementation challenges
3. Outcomes (fiscal, market, social)
4. Industry reaction
5. Public acceptance

**Comparable Context:**
- Small economy
- Transition to regulated online market
- Fiscal needs + harm concerns
- Need for efficient allocation

**Serbian Advantage:**
Being 12-18 months behind NZ = we learn from their mistakes AND successes.

### Monitoring Plan Deliverables Summary

**Total Expected Outputs (2025-2027):**
1. This Setup Document: `NZ-Monitoring-Plan-Setup.md` ✓
2. Quarterly Updates: 8 reports (Q1 2025 - Q4 2027)
3. Special Reports: 3-5 (bill analysis, auction design, results, etc.)
4. Final Comprehensive Report: `NZ-Final-Report-Lessons-Serbia.md`
5. Supporting Materials: Contact database, document library, timeline visualizations

**Estimated Total Pages:** 150-200 pages over 24 months

**Usage:**
- Inform Serbia licensing model design
- Evidence base for parliamentary debate
- Stakeholder education (industry, public health)
- Academic publication (policy learning)

### Final Note

This monitoring plan is **adaptive and iterative**. As NZ policy clarifies, we will refine focus. If auction model is NOT used, we pivot to analyze whatever mechanism IS used, and assess implications for Serbia.

**The value is not just in finding an auction precedent** (though that would be ideal), **but in documenting a comparable jurisdiction's approach to the same policy challenge Serbia faces.**
